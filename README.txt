The Leapfrog integrator and Stormer-Verlet integrator are compared against the Euler integrator.

All three are symplectic integrators that conserve the Hamiltonian along a flow line/ trajectory from an initial state/ point. However, the trajectories that the symplectic integrators take are different.

Note that the Leapfrog integrator only works on mechanical systems with kinetic energy that is half of the mass multiplied by the velocity squared.
